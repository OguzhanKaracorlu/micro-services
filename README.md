# Micro-Services Project

This repository contains a collection of microservices built with various technologies for demonstration and educational purposes.

## Overview

Microservices architecture is an ap<proach to developing a single application as a suite of small services, each running in its own process and communicating with lightweight mechanisms, often an HTTP resource API. These services are built around business capabilities and independently deployable by fully automated deployment machinery.

## Technologies Used

- **Service 1:** Built with Node.js and Express.js.
- **Service 2:** Utilizes Python Flask for implementation.
- **Service 3:** Developed using Java Spring Boot framework.
- **Service 4:** Utilizes Go programming language for implementation.
- **Service 5:** Developed with Ruby on Rails framework.
