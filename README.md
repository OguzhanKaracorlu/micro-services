Demo Java Micro Services Project

This project is a small demo project I prepared to understand the microservice architecture.

Spring framework is used. I've added it to git for the benefit of others.

It consists of 6 different services and is a small foreign exchange application.
Eureka includes api gateway and Feign technologies.
